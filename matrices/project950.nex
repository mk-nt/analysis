        	TEXT TAXON=3 TEXT='Nematocysts are from acontia';

        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='The capsule contains the tubule prior to discharge.  The capsule may be long and thin (elongate) or relatively shorter and wider (squat).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Prior to discharge, the tubule is inside the capsule.  The tubule will evert upon discharge through an opening associated with three triangular flaps or through a spot unmarked externnaly. Apical flaps are visible after discharge as a trio of triangles that point away from the tubule at the junction between tubule and capsule. If there are no flaps, the junction will lack any regular flaps or projections or may have irregular tears on the capsule surface adjacent to the tubule. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='The  tubule is the  threadlike structure that emerges from within the nematocyst capsule.  In discharged nematocysts like those pictured here, the part closer to the capsule is the basal tubule; the part farther away is the distal tubule.  The basal and distal tubule may each bear spines and may differ in their intrinsic diameter and texture.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='The discharged nematocyst has a tubule emanating from the paddle-shaped capsule.  The  tubule may have two or three distinct regions that differ in the arrangement, morphology, or length of the spines.^n^nNote: The paddle-shaped capsule is visible in some images.  This is not a region of the tubule, but a distinct structure.  The tubule is the thread-like structure that comes out of the capsule. ^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='The basal tubule generally bears long flat spines.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='The thread-like tubule that emanates from the capsule bears spines.  These spines may vary in shape, length, and arrangement along the length of the tubule. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='The long spines on the tubule may completely cover the tubule, or may be spaced so that the underlying tubule is visible. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='The surface of the basal tubule UNDER the spines is smooth or ringed by small folds that go around the tubule.  Note that some capsulea are wrinkled and compressed and so may have folds that run along the length of the tubule; ignore these wrinkles and look for regular texture that runs around the tubule. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='The distal tubule may bear spines; these are often not identical to those of the basal tubule in terms of size, density, or shape. ';
