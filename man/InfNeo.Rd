\title{Informative neomorphic cells}
\usage{
InfNeo(pID)
}
\arguments{
\item{pID}{Character specifying the project identifier to analyse}
}
\value{
\code{InfNeo()} invisibly returns a list with elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{"0"}}{Vector of per-taxon counts of cells scored as 0.}
\item{\code{"1"}}{Vector of per-taxon counts of cells scored as 1.}
\item{\code{"?"}}{Vector of per-taxon counts of ambiguous cells.}
\item{\code{"p1"}}{Vector of proportions of 1-cells among scored cells.}
\item{\code{"count"}}{Named vector giving total counts of 0-, 1-, and 0/1-cells across all taxa.}
\item{\code{"p"}}{Named vector giving overall proportions of 0 and 1 states among scored cells.}
}
}
\description{
Reads the neomorphic character matrix for a given project and extracts only
those characters that are informative (i.e., showing more than one repeated
state across taxa).  Returns per-taxon counts of neomorphic cell states,
together with proportions and overall counts.
}
\details{
The function reads the neomorphic matrix file \code{"neo.nex"} associated with
the given project ID, filters out uninformative characters, and calculates for
each taxon:
\itemize{
\item Number of cells with state \code{0} (\code{"0"})
\item Number of cells with state \code{1} (\code{"1"})
\item Number of ambiguous cells (\code{"?"})
\item Proportion of \code{1} cells among those scored as \code{0} or \code{1} (\code{"p1"})
}
}
