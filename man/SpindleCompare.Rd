\title{Comparative spindle plot of model Bayes factors}
\usage{
SpindleCompare(
  modelA,
  modelB,
  marginals,
  stdErr,
  nBin = 14,
  width = 1,
  xlab = "",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelA}{Character vector naming the first set of models to compare.}

\item{modelB}{Character vector naming the second set of models to compare;
must be the same length as \code{modelA}.}

\item{marginals}{Matrix of marginal log-likelihoods, with models as rows and
datasets as columns.}

\item{stdErr}{Matrix of standard errors corresponding to \code{marginals}.}

\item{nBin}{Integer giving the number of histogram bins to use for each
spindle (default \code{20}).}

\item{width}{Numeric scaling factor for the maximum spindle width (default \code{1}).}

\item{xlab}{Character label for the x-axis (default \code{"Model comparison"}).}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}}.}
}
\value{
\code{SpindleCompare()} returns a matrix whose rows correspond to the entries
in \code{modelA} and whose columns count:
\itemize{
\item \code{better}:  the number of times \code{modelA} outperforms \code{modelB};
\item \code{worse}:  the number of times \code{modelA} is outperformed by \code{modelB};
\item \code{n}:  the number of datasets compared, after removing \code{NA}s.
The function is called for its side-effect of producing a comparative spindle
plot.
}
}
\description{
\code{SpindleCompare()} draws side-by-side spindles comparing the marginal log
likelihoods of paired models. Each spindle shows the distribution of log Bayes
factors between the two models across datasets, with colours indicating which
model is favoured. Areas of non-material difference (where absolute log Bayes
factors are smaller than the propagated standard error) are shown in
semitransparent “ghost” shading.
}
\details{
Each spindle is constructed from the histogram of Bayes factors
\eqn{bf = marginals[modelA[i], ] - marginals[modelB[i], ]}.
Bars where \eqn{|bf| < .DiffErr(stdErr[modelA[i], ], stdErr[modelB[i], ])}
are shown in semitransparent colour; other bars are fully opaque. Positive
values (favouring \code{modelA}) are coloured by \code{ModelCol(modelA)}, and negative
values (favouring \code{modelB}) by \code{ModelCol(modelB)}.
