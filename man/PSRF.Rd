\title{Potential scale reduction factor (PSRF)}
\usage{
PSRF(runs, burnin)
}
\arguments{
\item{runs}{A list of numeric matrices, each representing an independent MCMC
chain with dimensions samples × parameters.}

\item{burnin}{Integer giving the number of initial samples to discard.}
}
\value{
\code{PSRF()} returns a numeric vector giving the PSRF for each parameter.
}
\description{
Computes the univariate potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) for assessing
MCMC convergence across multiple chains.
}
\details{
The PSRF compares between-chain and within-chain variances to assess whether
chains have mixed adequately. Values near 1 indicate convergence.
This implementation follows Equation 4 of Vats & Knudson (2021),
\emph{Statistical Science}, \doi{10.1214/20-STS812}.
