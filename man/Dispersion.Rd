\title{Summarize dispersion of tree distances within and between samples}
\usage{
Dispersion(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A distance matrix, typically the output of
\code{\link{TreeDistances}}.}
}
\value{
'Dispersion()' returns a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{treePairs}: a data frame of pairwise distances and comparison type
("1 vs 1", "1 vs 2", or "2 vs 2");
\item \code{spread}: a matrix summarising mean nearest-neighbour and MST edge
lengths, and median distances per run;
\item \code{mdmd}: the median-to-median distance between the two runs;
\item \code{sil}: the average silhouette width.
}
}
\description{
Computes within- and between-sample tree distance summaries, including
nearest-neighbour distances, mean minimum spanning tree edge length, median
distances, and silhouette width, for a distance matrix computed by
\code{\link{TreeDistances}}.
