\title{Create a new RevBayes analysis repository}
\usage{
MakeRepo(pID, scriptID)
}
\arguments{
\item{pID}{Character specifying the project identifier to analyse}

\item{scriptID}{Character specifying the script to run}
}
\value{
\code{MakeRepo()} invisibly returns \code{TRUE} when the repository has been created
and initialized successfully.
The function is called primarily for its side-effect of establishing a
corresponding GitHub repository and local working copy.
}
\description{
\code{MakeRepo()} establishes a new private GitHub repository for a given
project–script combination.
The repository will host all RevBayes scripts and associated matrix files
required for downstream analysis.
}
\details{
Before using this function, ensure that:
\enumerate{
\item The \href{https://cli.github.com/}{GitHub CLI} (\code{gh}) is installed and on
your system \code{PATH}.
\item You are authenticated with write access to the account specified in
\code{.Renviron} as:
\preformatted{
  ntGithubAccount=neo-trans
  }
\item You have configured your \code{.Renviron} file with SSH details for your
analysis cluster (see below).
}

Typical \code{.Renviron} entries (Windows paths shown) are:
\preformatted{
sshLogin=username@remote-host
sshKey=C:/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519
sshPass=key-passphrase
rb.exe=C:/Program Files/revbayes-vX.Y.Z/bin/rb.exe
}

You can edit this file by running \code{usethis::edit_r_environ()} and must
restart R for changes to take effect.

On success, a new repository named
\verb{<ntGithubAccount>/<project>_<script>.git} is created on GitHub and cloned
locally to the appropriate subdirectory.
