# Mk-nt analysis files

This repository contains scripts necessary to replicate the analyses of 

Smith & Yang (2024), "Improving Phylogenetic Inference by Detecting Asymmetric 
Evolutionary Rates in Morphological Characters".

We assume that you have `git` and `gh` installed locally and in the system path.

To reproduce the analyses:

1. Fork this GitHub repository.

2. Open `R/_setup.R` and adjust configuration variables.
   You will need to replace the value of `githubAccount` with a (probably
   organizational) account.
   You will need to configure a personal access token (PAT) with permissions to
   create and write to repositories in that GitHub account.
   A PAT with write access should be stored on your cluster as the 
   environment variable `MKNT_WRITE`.
   A PAT with read access should be stored on your computer as the
   environment variable `MKNT_READ`.
   
3. Execute `R/1_PrepareMatrix.R`.
   This script uses the Excel spreadsheets in `matrices/*.xlsx` to identify each
   character in the corresponding nexus file `matrices/*.nex` as neomorphic
   or transformational.
   It creates two new nexus files, 
   `projects/project<projectID>.trans.nex` containing the transformational
   characters, `*.neo.nex`, the neomorphic characters.
   Parsimony-uninformative characters are removed.
   
   These matrices, along with RevBayes scripts for phylogenetic inference 
   (`mcmcmc.Rev`) and marginal likelihood calculation (`marginal.Rev`),
   created from templates in `rbScripts`,
   are commited to a new GitHub repository at
   `githubAccount/<projectID>_<modelID>`.
   
   A slurm script for each analysis is created in the `slurm` directory, using
   the templates `slurm/mcmcmc.sh` and `slurm/marginal.sh`.
   References to `mk-nt` in these templates should be updated to refer to
   your `githubAccount`.
   
4. Log into a computing cluster and configure RevBayes.
   We recommend building the development version, which fixes some bugs in
   v1.2.4 that caused some analyses to fail.
   
5. Check out your fork of the repository, navigate to its root directory,
   and execute `bash qsub.sh`.  This will submit the slurm jobs defined by
   `RevBayes()` to the slurm queue.  Once complete, each job will commit its
   results to its associated GitHub repository.
   
6. Back on your own computer, execute `R/2_CheckCompletion.R`.
   `UpdateRecords()` fetches RevBayes results from GitHub and performs initial
   analyses, such as computing convergence diagnostics and estimated sample
   size.

   Some datasets may require extended runtimes or additional memory to complete.
   You may need to modify `R/MakeSlurm.R` to reflect the available resources on
   your own compute cluster.
   
   Results once available are stored in `results/project<projectID>`:
   - Each `<projectID>_<modelID>.trees` file contains a sample of 256 topologies
     from the posterior.
   - `*.rds` stores the distances between each pair of trees.
   - `*-conv.txt` records convergence diagnostics and the estimated sample size
     after discarding a fraction of the results (given by `burnin`) as burnin.
     Note that RevBayes discards the 3000 generations in which move proposals
     were being optimised; in some cases these generations suffice as a burnin
     phase.
   - `*-stone.txt` records:
    - An estimate of the marginal likelihood obtained by stepping stone sampling
    - An estimate of the marginal likelihood obtained by path sampling
    - The number of generations discarded as burnin when deriving the power
      posterior
    - The number of generations used in the power posterior run
    - The number of steps used in the power posterior run

7. Once analyses are complete, execute `R/3_Analysis.R`.
   This script is admittedly inelegant.
   It contains code used to explore the properties of the results, as well as
   to create the manuscript figures and supplementary table.
   
   Exploring changes in tree topology between models requires distance
   computations to be cached. 
   Where a cache is unavailable, `.TreeStats()` will print a list of calls to
   `AnalysisPDF()` that should be conducted after running
   `source("R/AnalysisPDF.R")`.
   This will cache tree-to-tree distances in
   `rbPDF/project<projectID>-<modelID1>-<modelID2>.dist.rds`, 
   and visualize distances in a summary PDF `rbPDF/*.pdf`.
